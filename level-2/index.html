    Level 2 - Match Game

    I really enjoyed making this game and I am really proud of
    the end result. The process of creating it mostly went well,
    apart from a small set back when I was trying to interpolate
    the flipping animation (as it turns out it was just colliding
    CSS selectors). All of this was review of known concepts for
    me, but it was still really fun to make. One thing that I
    found funny upon reviewing my code was how I basically
    implemented a really basic component system for the tiles
    because I've been using React so much lately.

                    The goal of this game is to reveal every tile in the grid below. Each time you
                    click on a tile, it will be flipped over to reveal an image. You must then click
                    on another tile with a matching image.
                </p>
                <p>If you click on a tile with a different image, both tiles will flip back over.</p>
                <p>If you click on a matching tile, both tiles will remain flipped.</p>
